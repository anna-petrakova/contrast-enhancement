# contrast-enhancement

Application for enhancing the contrast of a photography with an uneven illumination problem. The implementation of an algorithm is based on illumination estimation using nonlinear diffusion whose equation is solved via explicit scheme and Additive Operator Splitting scheme. This algorithm was proposed by Z. Liang, W. Liu, R. Yao. Contrast enhancement by nonlinear diffusion filtering. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 25(2):673-685, 2016
